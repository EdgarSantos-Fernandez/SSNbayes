Description: Fits Bayesian spatio-temporal models and makes predictions on stream networks using the approach by Santos-Fernandez, Edgar, et al. (2021)."Bayesian spatio-temporal models for stream networks". arXiv:2103.03538. In these models, spatial dependence is captured using stream distance and flow connectivity, while temporal autocorrelation is modelled using vector autoregression methods.

# SSNbayes 0.1.0

* This version brings 2 main updates to the package.
* The first expands the modelling methodology to incorporate response data from Poisson and binomial distributions.
* The second allows the usage of this package without a SpatialStreamNetwork. Instead, the user can generate an object called `osm_ssn`, an Open Street Maps Spatial Stream Network, which contains all of the required distance matrices for modelling. See ssnbayes2(). 

* These updates do not affect the previous modelling using the functions: ssnbayes() and predict().


# SSNbayes 0.0.3

* Added support to SSN2.
